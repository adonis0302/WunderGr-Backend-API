The [Expo + Relay example](https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergraph/tree/main/examples/expo-relay) demonstrates how to use Relay with a Expo based WunderGraph project to build mobile apps.

## Getting Started

First, run the wundergraph development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

In another shell, start expo

```sh
npm run expo:start
```

Open your app in iOS / Android simulator to view the result.

You can start editing the app by modifying `App.tsx`. The screen auto-updates as you edit the file.
